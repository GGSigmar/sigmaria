    Character creation in Age of Fallen Empires setting is very similar to the official rules, but, as it often happens to be, the devil is in the details.
    Below you can find a list of steps necessary to create a character.
    Most of them work exactly as suggested in the CRB (Core Rulebook) of Second Edition of Pathfinder RPG, so you should refer to them if possible (they start at page 19).
    Those few steps that differ from the official rules are (I hope) comprehensively explained.
